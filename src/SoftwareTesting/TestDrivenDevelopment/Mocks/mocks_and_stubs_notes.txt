- lets you scale up TDD process to multi-layered architectures
that have external dependencies like web services and so on --
data from other peoples systems
- how to test external dependencies like database calls, HTTP requests, etc.
- use mocks and stubs to simulate the behaviour of a class

STUBS
- a stub is a test double -- used to stand in for a real object
- returns whether test data we want it to return (hardcoded test data)
- stubs allow us to separate our concerns -- in this case, the database connection
or the HTTP request (the external dependencies)
- test our logic with other people's data, make the source of the data
someone else's problem

MOCKS
- sometimes when we talk to external dependencies, we might not be fetching data
but rather processing commands (e.g. external queries) using an api
- a mock object is something that allows us to test that a method on an
interface was invoked (e.g., a message is sent)
- an object that implements the interface?? (19:00)
- use dependency mockito by maven

DUMMY OBJECTS
- another kind of test double
- dummy = null object -- a placeholder

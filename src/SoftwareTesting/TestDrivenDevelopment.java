    // TDD = use tests to guide design of your code.

    // 3 steps in TDD:
    //
    // 1. Red Light: Start by writing a test that initially fails that describes required (but absent) functionality.
    // 2. Green Light: Write the simplest code you can think of to pass the unittests.
    // 3. Yellow Light: If necessary, refactor code to make future changes easy.
    // look for difficult to understand code, complexity, duplication, dependencies,
    // code smells.

    // TDD = use tests to guide design of your code.

    // 3 steps in TDD:
    //
    // 1. Start by writing a test that initially fails that is required functionality.
    // 2. Write the simplest code you can think of to pass the unittests.
    // 3. If necessary, refactor code to make future changes easy.
    // look for difficult to understand code, complexity, duplication, dependencies,
    // code smells.
